## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- I often need to jot down notes, highlight ideas, or illustrate concepts directly on my desktop.
- Being able to turn my computer into a simple **“blackboard”** whenever I need it is super handy.
- I’m also using this project as a chance to get better at building desktop apps with **PySide2 / Qt**.

<br>

## 🧩 Features
- ✏️ **Free Drawing** – Draw anywhere on your screen with smooth strokes
- &nbsp;█&nbsp; **Eraser Tools** – Normal eraser + rectangular crop eraser
- 🎨 **Brush Controls** – Change size, shape, and 7 colors instantly
- ↩️ **Undo / Redo** – Full history tracking for every stroke
- 🖼️ **Screenshot Export** – Save with black or transparent background
- 🧰 **Floating Toolbar** – Quick access to all tools in one place
